I want to create a bot that will do the audit work of Information security, doing things like Risk qualification, Cyber Risk, Risk Quantification and Risk Scoring. I want to use Python, Langchain, open source LLm models from langchain community Ollamaand streamlit for UI/UX. There will be a section, where I can upload information security policy documents, another section to upload soc 2 report and company CRI profile, another section to upload evidences files like various logs of database and other configurations which need to be assessed. Supported File types are PDF, txt, CSV, XLSX and evidence screenshots as JPEG files. There should be a button to Run processing of uploaded files after user has finished uploading files. The bot should then study the evidence logs and understand the context like whether those are database logs, password logs, etc. The bot would then do the assessment of the evidence files based on the uploaded policies and other documents and prepare a cyber risk information security audit workbook. The workbook can be downloaded. There will also be a section from where users can chat with the bot.
